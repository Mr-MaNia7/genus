# Genus - Traditional Music Genre Classification
The idea behind this python machine learning project is to develop a machine learning project and automatically classify different musical genres from audio. We need to classify these audio files using their low-level features of frequency and time domain.

# Introduction
Music classification is a music information retrieval (MIR) task whose objective is the computational understanding of music semantics. For a given song, the classifier predicts relevant musical attributes. The retrieved information can be further utilized in many applications including music recommendation, curation, playlist generation, and semantic search.

The model trained will be used as a Single-label classification, meaning it will only label music as belonging to one of the four well known Ethiopian music genres (ቅኝቶች) namely ambasel (አምባሰል), bati (ባቲ), anchi hoye (አንቺ ሆዬ) or tizita (ትዝታ).


# The Machine Learning
